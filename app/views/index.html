      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What this is</h3>
      <p>This is code to implement form validation in the kit, with examples of different types of validation you can do - the validation code can be copied and used in your prototype.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What this isn't</h3>
      <p>This isn't a guide as to when to use each type of component, and not what the error messages should be.  For your protoype you should get <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/">the latest guidance and component HTML/Nunjucks macros from the design system</a></p>

      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
      	<p>This example code is built in the current kit - {{releaseVersion}} - March 2020.  You could use this repo as a starting point for your protoype.  But the gov kit will change - so always make a call as to whether to <a href="https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs">use the latest kit from the design system</a>. How do i know <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit/releases">what version number the current gov kit is?</a></p>
      	<p>If you are using <a href="https://github.com/LandRegistry/govuk-prototype-kit-form-validation">this repo/copy of the kit</a> as the basis of your prototype you don't need to follow the setup guide.  Just <a href="validation-documentation.html#component-rules">look at the validcation rules</a> section and find pages that work and copy the code you need</p>
